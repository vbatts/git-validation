# git-validation

A way to do validation on git commits.

## install

```bash
vbatts@valse ~ (master) $ go get -u github.com/vbatts/git-validation
```

## usage

The flags
```bash
vbatts@valse ~/src/vb/git-validation (master *) $ git-validation -h
Usage of git-validation:
  -D    debug output
  -d string
        git directory to validate from (default ".")
  -list-rules
        list the rules registered
  -range string
        use this commit range instead
  -run string
        comma delimited list of rules to run. Defaults to all.
  -v    verbose
```

The entire default rule set is run by default:
```bash
vbatts@valse ~/src/vb/git-validation (master) $ git-validation -list-rules
"DCO" -- makes sure the commits are signed
"short-subject" -- commit subjects are strictly less than 90 (github ellipsis length)
```

Or, specify comma-delimited rules to run:
```bash
vbatts@valse ~/src/vb/git-validation (master) $ git-validation -run DCO,short-subject
 * b243ca4 "README: adding install and usage" ... PASS
 * d614ccf "*: run tests in a runner" ... PASS
 * b9413c6 "shortsubject: add a subject length check" ... PASS
 * 5e74abd "*: comments and golint" ... PASS
 * 07a982f "git: add verbose output of the commands run" ... PASS
 * 03bda4b "main: add filtering of rules to run" ... PASS
 * c10ba9c "Initial commit" ... PASS
```

Verbosity shows each rule's output:
```bash
vbatts@valse ~/src/vb/git-validation (master) $ git-validation -v
 * d614ccf "*: run tests in a runner" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
 * b9413c6 "shortsubject: add a subject length check" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
 * 5e74abd "*: comments and golint" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
 * 07a982f "git: add verbose output of the commands run" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
 * 03bda4b "main: add filtering of rules to run" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
 * c10ba9c "Initial commit" ... PASS
  - PASS - has a valid DCO
  - PASS - commit subject is 72 characters or less! *yay*
```

Here's a failure:
```bash
vbatts@valse ~/src/vb/git-validation (master) $ git-validation 
 * 49f51a8 "README: adding install and usage" ... FAIL
  - FAIL - does not have a valid DCO
 * d614ccf "*: run tests in a runner" ... PASS

## Rules

Default rules are added by registering them to the `validate` package.
Usually by putting them in their own package.
See [`./rules/`](./rules/).
Feel free to contribute more.

Otherwise, by using `validate` package API directly, rules can be handed directly to the `validate.Runner`.
